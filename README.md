# Flutter Nested Navigation

![Project Demo](https://github.com/itsniaz/Flutter-Nested-Navigation/raw/main/assets/demo.gif)

## Overview

Flutter Nested Navigation is a demonstration project that showcases how to efficiently manage navigation within a single screen using multiple navigation stacks. This technique can be particularly useful when dealing with complex UI flows and nested navigation scenarios.

In this project, we've provided a practical example of how to implement nested navigation. Our goal is to help you gain a deeper understanding of the concept, making it easier for you to integrate into your own Flutter applications.

## Project Features

- Demonstrates the power of nested navigation within Flutter.
- Shows how to handle complex navigation scenarios within a single screen.
- Helps streamline user interactions and improve navigation flow.
